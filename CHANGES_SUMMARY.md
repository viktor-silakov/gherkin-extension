# Summary of Changes - Version 0.0.6

## Problem Fixed
The "Go to Definition" functionality was redirecting to wrong files and line numbers when clicking on Gherkin steps.

## Root Cause
1. **Line mapping issue**: Complex algorithm for mapping lines after comment removal was causing incorrect line number calculations
2. **False positive matches**: Empty or very short step definitions (from comments) were matching any text input

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Simplified Line Mapping Algorithm
**File**: `gserver/src/steps.handler.ts`
- Replaced complex line mapping logic with simple 1:1 mapping
- Works because `strip-comments` preserves line numbers with `preserveNewlines: true`
- Reduced code complexity from ~30 lines to 4 lines

### 2. Added Step Definition Validation
**File**: `gserver/src/steps.handler.ts`
- Added validation to skip empty or very short step definitions (< 3 characters)
- Prevents false matches from comments and documentation
- Improves accuracy of step definition detection

### 3. Added Regression Tests
**File**: `gserver/test/steps.handler.spec.ts`
- Added comprehensive tests for line mapping after comment removal
- Added test for specific "I wait for 1 seconds" scenario
- Ensures the fix works correctly and prevents future regressions

### 4. Updated Dependencies
**File**: `package.json`
- Added `strip-comments@2.0.1` dependency for reliable comment removal
- Updated version to 0.0.6

### 5. Updated Documentation
**File**: `CHANGELOG.md`
- Added detailed changelog entry for version 0.0.6
- Documented both the line mapping fix and false positive prevention

## Test Results
- All 277 existing tests pass
- New regression tests added and passing
- Extension successfully packaged as `gherkin-extension-0.0.6.vsix`

## Expected Behavior After Fix
When using F12 or Ctrl+Click on:
```gherkin
When I wait for 1 seconds
```

VSCode should now correctly navigate to:
- **File**: `test/taf-ms/src/step_definitions/web/actions.sd.ts`
- **Line**: `670`
- **Step Definition**: `When('I wait for {int} seconds', ...)`
